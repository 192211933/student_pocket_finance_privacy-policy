    <h1>Privacy Policy - Student Pocket Finance</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

    <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Student Pocket Finance</strong>, a student-focused finance management app that helps you
        track your income, expenses, upcoming bills, and financial reports. Your privacy is very important to us,
        and we are committed to protecting the personal and financial information you share with us.
    </p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What data we collect from students and parents.</li>
        <li>How we use and store your data.</li>
        <li>How the parent dashboard accesses student data.</li>
        <li>Your rights and choices regarding your data.</li>
        <li>How to contact us for questions or requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Student Account Information</h3>
    <p>When a student signs up or logs in, we may collect and store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Full name</li>
        <li>College name</li>
        <li>Email address (used as the main identifier for your account)</li>
        <li>Password (stored securely on the server, not in plain text)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Parent Account Information</h3>
    <p>When a parent creates or uses a parent account, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Parent name</li>
        <li>Parent email address</li>
        <li>Linked student email address</li>
        <li>Password (stored securely on the server, not in plain text)</li>
        <li>Phone number (provided during parent registration)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Financial and Usage Data</h3>
    <p>To provide the core features of the app, we process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Income entries (amount, category, date, notes)</li>
        <li>Expense entries (amount, category, date, notes)</li>
        <li>Upcoming bills (bill type, due date, amount, notes, status)</li>
        <li>Balance information (current balance, total income, total expenses)</li>
        <li>Generated reports (summaries by category, totals, and history)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 Technical and Log Data</h3>
    <p>When you use the app, our servers may automatically receive certain information, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address and basic device information (via standard web/server logs)</li>
        <li>Request details related to login, registration, and data fetch/update operations</li>
        <li>Basic error or failure information when network or server issues occur</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect GPS location data, background location tracking, or payment card details
        inside the app based on the current implementation.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the data we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account creation and login</strong>: To authenticate students and parents using their email and password.</li>
        <li><strong>Finance management</strong>: To store and display your incomes, expenses, upcoming bills, balances, and reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Parent dashboard</strong>: To securely allow linked parents to view summarized student financial data (balance, expenses, bills, and categories) when access is granted via student email.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization</strong>: To show your name, college name, and relevant financial summaries in the UI.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication</strong>: To send important account-related messages or notifications (for example, on errors, changes, or critical updates, where implemented).</li>
        <li><strong>Security and misuse prevention</strong>: To detect suspicious activity and protect accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Improvement of the app</strong>: To understand how features are used and to fix bugs or improve performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Storing your data on secure servers behind appropriate safeguards.</li>
        <li>Using server-side validation and authentication for all requests.</li>
        <li>Not storing your password in plain text (passwords are handled securely on the backend).</li>
        <li>Limiting access to personal and financial data to authorized components and roles (student vs. parent).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Communication between the app and the server is handled via network requests to our backend. We aim to use
        secure protocols and configurations. However, you should avoid using the app on untrusted or insecure
        networks whenever possible.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Parent Access to Student Data</h2>
    <p>
        The app includes a <strong>Parent Dashboard</strong> feature, which allows registered parents to view certain
        financial information about a linked student account.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Parents log in using their own email, password, and the student email they are linked to.</li>
        <li>Parents may see the student’s balance, expenses, bills, and summary reports.</li>
        <li>This access is designed to help parents monitor and guide student spending and budgeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Student data displayed in the parent dashboard is read-only from the parent’s side; parents do not directly
        edit the student’s transactions through the current app design.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>As a user (student or parent), you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access your data</strong>: View your profile information, linked emails, and financial records within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Update your information</strong>: Correct your profile data where editing options are available.</li>
        <li><strong>Request deletion</strong>: Ask us to delete your account and associated personal data, subject to legal and operational requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdraw from parent linking</strong>: Students may request that parent access be removed or changed (subject to how the institution chooses to manage this).</li>
        <li><strong>Opt out of marketing</strong>: If we send any promotional communications in the future, you may opt out at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details in the <strong>Contact Us</strong> section
        below.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We retain your personal and financial data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the
        services described in this policy. We may also retain certain information for a reasonable period after
        account deletion to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Student Pocket Finance uses certain third-party technologies to function, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Server hosting providers</strong>: To host the backend and database that store your information.</li>
        <li><strong>Networking libraries</strong> (such as Retrofit and related tools in the app): To communicate securely with our backend services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These service providers are required to handle data responsibly and in line with applicable privacy and
        security standards. We do not currently integrate external analytics SDKs, maps/location APIs, or payment
        gateways directly in the mobile app based on the present implementation.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Student Pocket Finance is primarily intended for students in higher education and their parents or guardians.
        It is not designed for children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information
        from a child under 13 without appropriate consent, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as
        possible.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app, legal requirements, or
        our data practices. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page, and we may
        notify you within the app or by other reasonable means.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your data, you can contact us at:</p>
